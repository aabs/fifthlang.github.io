Fifth is a small, general purpose language designed to make working with RDF knowledge graphs easier.  
By making RDF graphs a first class part of the language, and by providing syntactic sugar that 
ought to be familiar to most programmers, I hope to:

- Drive RDF adoption
- Make RDF development the fastest way to work with graph data

Fifth builds on top of the .NET 5 runtime, and should be portable to anywhere you can run a .NET runtime.
Syntax design is still quite fluid, and most features are not present, but the language pipeline is mostly done.
